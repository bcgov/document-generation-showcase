## Summary

> Document Generation (DGEN) is a Web based service that provides NRM business users with the capability to generate standardized documents and letters using structured templates. DGEN implements capabilities similar to Word’s Mail Merge but DGEN is much more powerful. In addition, DGEN templates do not have to be rebuilt after every Word upgrade.   

### Capabilities  

- The capability to centrally share, access, and manage documents
- The capability to generate reusable templates for legal documents and form letters (e.g. permits & licenses)  
- A scalable document generation engine that allows multiple users to simultaneously generate documents  
- A library of document templates, secured by business area and stored in the document management system
